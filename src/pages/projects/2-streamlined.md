StreamLined is a tool to track movies and TV shows a user would like to watch, are currently watching, and track media a user has watched. Once a user has created a StreamLined account, they can access a dashboard with three default lists to categorize their media: 'Currently Watching,' 'Want to Watch,' and 'Watched.' Additionally, the user can search for movies and TV shows by title, view the media details, and save to the appropriate list in their dashboard. Once a user has finished watching their show or movie, they can provide reviews and ratings. In future iterations of this application, users of this app will be able to add their streaming services to their profile and search for their desired media based on the streaming service available to the user.
