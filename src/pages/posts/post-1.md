Welcome to my _new blog_ about my technical journey! Here I will share my learning journey as I grow as a software developer.

## What I've accomplished so far in Astro for this blog

1. **Installing Astro**
2. **Making Pages**
3. **Making this blog post** Its pretty interesting that this post is just written in markdown. My previous markdown experience has been exclusively in READMEs and gists.

## Whats next

I will finish the Astro tutorial and continue making posts of my learnings. Some posts may be longwinded some may be just a few sentences about something I learned.
